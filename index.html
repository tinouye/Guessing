<p>Created by Tomi Inouye
This is a guessing game in which the user is asked yes or no questions regarding the author.
The user must type in "yes", "Yes", "YES", "y", or  "Y" to answer yes,
or "no", "No", "NO", "n", or "N" to answer no to the yes or no questions.
To answer the numeric questions, the user must type arabic numerals.
The code resides in game.js, and the game is run by running index.html.
Images files are in the 'images' directory.</p>

<p>I didn't want to believe that my friend was a construction sign thief, but when I got home all the signs were there.</p>
